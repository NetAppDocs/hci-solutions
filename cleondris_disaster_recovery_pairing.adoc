The far side of the screen displays some useful information, such as how many protected VMs you have. (In this example, none right now.) You can also access the Replication Wizard here.

It is important to make sure that the disaster recovery site vCenter Server is displayed and that all hosts are selected. After that is complete, use the Preview button.

. Next you see a summary. You can click Create DR to set the volume pairing and start replication.
+

Depending on your settings, replication might take a while. I suggest that you wait overnight.
