With Anthos, organizations can scale their environments to incorporate multiple user clusters and segregate workloads between teams. A single admin cluster can support up to five user clusters, and each user cluster can support up to twenty-five nodes.

To add additional user clusters to your deployment, complete the following steps:

1. Copy the `config.yaml` file to a new file named `anthos-cluster02-config.yaml`.
+
----
ubuntu@Anthos-Admin-Workstation:~$ cp config.yaml anthos-cluster02-config.yaml
----

2. Make the following edits to the newly created file:
a. Comment out the sections that refer to the existing admin cluster with (#).
b. When you get to the `usercluster` section, update the following fields:
i) Update the partition name under the `bigip` section.
ii) Update the `controlplanvip` and `ingressvip` values under the `vip` section.
iii) Update the `clustername` value.

3. Run the following command to check the config file again to verify that there are no syntax errors. Because you have removed the admin section, you must reference the `kubeconfig` file for the admin cluster named `kubeconfig` (found in the working directory).

ubuntu@Anthos-Admin-Workstation:~$ gkectl check-config --config anthos-cluster02-config.yaml --kubeconfig kubeconfig

4. If all the checks succeed as expected, you can deploy this new user cluster in a manner very similar to the first cluster creation, referencing the `kubeconfig` file from the admin cluster.
+
----
ubuntu@Anthos-Admin-Workstation:~$ gkectl create cluster --config anthos-cluster02-config.yaml --kubeconfig kubeconfig
----

5. As with the previous deployment, the process runs for several minutes and can be monitored on screen and in vCenter by watching the resource pool as the VMs populate. When complete, you should be able to see the new user cluster (four nodes).
+

6. You can access and execute commands against the deployed user cluster using the kubectl command line tool and the `kubeconfig` file generated by the process (stored in the working directory).
