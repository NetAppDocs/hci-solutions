Over time, customers have found other uses for disaster recovery orchestration tools. For example, they test application and OS upgrades in a test failover. This testing is better than testing in a lab, because it uses the actual production bitsâ€”which means that,  when done in production,  the process will be as smooth as in the test failover. I have also seen security vulnerability testing done as a test failover first to determine what applications might be negatively affected.
