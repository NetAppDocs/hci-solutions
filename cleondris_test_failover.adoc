A test failover is important, because it will prove—to yourself, to your application owner, to your manager, and to the BCDR people—that the disaster recovery plans work.

To test failover, complete the following steps:

. From the Failover page, click Start Failover.

. On the Failover page,  you have some choices to make.

+

Carefully specify the plan, where the VMs came from, and where they are going to be recovered.

+

The screen displays a list of the VMs that are in the plan. In this example, a warning at the top right says that three VMs are not included. That means there are three VMs we did not make part of the plan in the replicated volume.
+

If you see a red X in the first column on the left,  you can click it and learn what the problem is.

. At the bottom right of the screen, you must choose whether to test the failover (Failover to Sandbox) or start a real failover. In this example, we select Failover to Sandbox.

. A summary now lists plans in action. For more information, use the magnifying glass in the far left (described in “Monitoring,” later in this document).
