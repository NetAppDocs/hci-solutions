This technical report helps you protect your IT infrastructure so that, in a critical outage, you can bring back your application services much faster. It also enables you to test updates and patches for your tier 1 applications more safely. It helps with installation, configuration, and use of the Cleondris HCI Control Center (HCC) disaster recovery tool on your NetApp HCI infrastructure.

Itâ€™s a good idea to review the entire document before starting installation or configuration.
