This solution employs the recommended self-hosted engine architecture of RHV deployment with the minimum setup (two self-hosted engine nodes). These steps begin after the nodes have been racked and cabled and the IPMI port has been configured on each node for using the console. To deploy the RHV-H hypervisor on HCI compute nodes, complete the following steps:

. Access the out-of-band management console for the compute nodes in the cluster and log in with the default credentials ADMIN/ADMIN.

. Click the Remote Console Preview image in the center of the screen to download a JNLP file launched by Java Web Start, which launches an interactive console to the system.

. After the virtual console launches, attach the RHV-H 4.3.9 ISO by navigating to and clicking Virtual Media > Virtual Storage.
