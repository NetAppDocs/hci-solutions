The program solutions described in this document are designed and thoroughly tested to minimize deployment risks and accelerate time to market.

This document is for NetApp and partner solutions engineers and customer strategic decision makers. It describes the architecture design considerations that were used to determine the specific equipment, cabling, and configurations required to support the validated workload.

NetApp HCI with Anthos is a verified, best-practice hybrid cloud architecture for the deployment of an on-premises Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environment in a reliable and dependable manner. This NetApp Verified Architecture reference document serves as both a design guide and a deployment validation of the Anthos solution on NetApp HCI. The architecture described in this document has been validated by subject matter experts at NetApp and Google to provide the advantage of running Anthos on NetApp HCI within your own enterprise data-center environment.

NetApp HCI, is the industryâ€™s first and leading disaggregated hybrid cloud infrastructure, providing the widely recognized benefits of hyperconverged solutions. Benefits include lower TCO and ease of acquisition, deployment, and management for virtualized workloads, while also allowing enterprise customers to independently scale compute and storage resources as needed. NetApp HCI with Anthos provides an on-premises, cloud-like experience for the deployment of containerized workloads managed by Anthos GKE on-premises. This solution provides simplified management, detailed metrics, and a range of additional functionalities that enable the easy movement of workloads deployed both on-site and in the cloud.

== Features
