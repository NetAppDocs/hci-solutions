An execute-only account can be useful for a manager to trigger a failover without saving the changes. You create this account yourself.

First, create a role that has the following privileges:

* Login

* Inventory_sf_view

* Inventory_vc_view

* Restore_exec_sf_failover

* Failover_view

* Failover_job_modify

* Failover_config_view

When the role is done, create a user with that role; the resulting account is an execute- only account. This set of privileges lets the user look at and change things but not save the changes.
