If you do not have a BIA, you can do a version of it yourself:  an application catalog.  

It is often done in a spreadsheet with the following fields: application name, components, requirements, owner, support, support phone number, and sponsor or business application owner.  Such a catalog is important and useful in protecting your applications. The help desk can sometimes help with an application catalog; they often have already started one.
