VM state is preserved during a failover. A VM that is powered on (or off) in production will be in the same state after a failover or during a test failover. However, be aware that HCC scans vCenter every 20 minutes. Therefore, you need to wait for that scan, or use the refresh button in HCC to immediately refresh.
