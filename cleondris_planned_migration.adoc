Planned migration is similar to a disaster recovery failover, but because it is not a disaster recovery situation, it can be handled slightly differently. It is still good to practice the planned migration, but you can add something to your failover group: You can unregister the VM from the source. That takes a little more time, but in a planned migration that is not a bad thing.

A planned migration is usually a move to a new domain controller. Sometimes it is also used if destructive weather is approaching but has not yet arrived.
