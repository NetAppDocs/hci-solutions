You can use HCC to enable replication between your two sites. This allows us to stay in the HCC UI and decide what volumes to replicate.

Important: If a replicated volume contains VMs that are in two plans, only the first plan that fails over will work, because it will disable replication on that volume.

I recommend that each tier 1 application have its own volume. Tier 4 applications can all be on one volume, but there should be only one failover plan.
