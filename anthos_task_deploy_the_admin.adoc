All Kubernetes clusters deployed as a part of the Anthos solution are deployed from the Anthos admin workstation that you just created. A user logs into the admin workstation using SSH, the public key created in a previous step, and the IP address provided at the end of the VM deployment. An admin cluster controls all actions in an Anthos environment. The admin cluster must be deployed first, and then individual user clusters can be deployed for specific workload needs.

NOTE:	There are specific procedures for deploying clusters that use static IP addresses link:https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem/1.6/how-to/install-static-ips[here^], and procedures for environments with DHCP can be found link:https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem/1.6/how-to/install-dhcp[here^]. In this guide, we use the second set of instructions for ease of deployment.

To deploy the admin cluster, complete the following steps:

. Log into your admin-workstation using the SSH command prompted at the end of the deployment. After successful authentication, you can list the files in the home directory, which are used to create the admin cluster and additional clusters later on. The directory also includes the copied vCenter cert and the access key for Anthos that was created in earlier steps.

. Use scp to copy the remaining keys for your Anthos account over from the workstation you deployed the admin-workstation from.

----

. Edit the admin-cluster.yaml file so that it is specific to the deployed environment. The file is very large, so we will address it by sections.
.. Most of the information is already filled in by default based on the configuration used to deploy the admin-workstation by gkeadm. This first section confirms the information for the version of Anthos being deployed and the vCenter instance it is deployed on. It also allows you to define a local data disk (VMDK) for Kubernetes object data.

.. FIll out the networking section next, and select whether you are using static or DHCP mode. If you are using static addresses, you must create an IP-block file based on the instructions linked to above, and add it to the config file.
+

NOTE:	If static IPs are used in a deployment, the items under the host configuration are global. This includes static IPs for clusters or those used for SeeSaw load balancers, which are configured later.

----

.. For a SeeSaw load balancer, you must create an additional external file to supply the static IP information for the load balancer. Create the file `admin-seesaw-block.yaml`, which was referenced in this configuration section.

blocks:
  - netmask: "255.255.255.0"

----
.. The last section of the admin config file contains additional options that can be tuned to fit the specific deployment environment. These include enabling anti-affinity groups if Anthos is being deployed on less than three ESXi servers. You can also configure proxies, private docker registries, and the connections to Stackdriver and Google Cloud for auditing.
+

----
antiAffinityGroups:
  # Set to false to disable DRS rule creation
  enabled: false
# (Optional) Specify the proxy configuration
proxy:
  # The URL of the proxy
  url: ""
  # The domains and IP addresses excluded from proxying

# # (Optional) Use a private Docker registry to host GKE images
# privateRegistry:
#   # Do not include the scheme with your registry address
#   address: ""
#   credentials:
#     username: ""
#     password: ""

  # A GCP region where you would like to store logs and metrics for this cluster.
  clusterLocation: "us-east1"
  enableVPC: false
  # The absolute or relative path to the key file for a GCP service account used to
  # send logs and metrics from the cluster

# # (Optional) Configure kubernetes apiserver audit logging

#   serviceaccountkeypath: ""
----
+

NOTE: The deployment detailed in this document is a minimum configuration for validation that requires the disabling of anti-affinity rules. NetApp recommends leaving this option set to true in production deployments.
+

NOTE: By default, Anthos on VMware uses a pre-existing, Google-owned container image registry that requires no additional setup. If you choose to use a private Docker registry for deployment, then you must configure that registry separately based on instructions found https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem/1.6/how-to/install-dhcp/#configure_docker_for_instalation[here]. This step is beyond the scope of this deployment guide.

. When edits to the admin-cluster.yaml file are complete, be sure to check for proper syntax and spacing.
+
----
ubuntu@gke-admin-200915-151421:~$ gkectl check-config –config admin-cluster.yaml
----
+

. After the configuration check has passed and any identified issues have been remedied, you can then stage the deployment of the cluster. Since we have already checked the validation of the config file, we can skip those steps by passing the `–-skip-validation-all` flag.
+
----
ubuntu@gke-admin-200915-151421:~$ gkectl prepare --config admin-cluster.yaml --skip-validation-all
----

. If you are using a SeeSaw load balancer, you must create one before deploying the cluster itself (otherwise skip this step).
+
----
ubuntu@gke-admin-200915-151421:~$ gkectl create loadbalancer --config admin-cluster.yaml
----

. You can now stand up the admin cluster. This is done with the `gkectl create` admin command, which can use the `–-skip-validation-all` flag to speed up deployment.
+
----
ubuntu@gke-admin-200915-151421:~$ gkectl create admin --config admin-cluster.yaml --skip-validation-all
----

. When the cluster is deployed, it creates the kubeconfig file in the local directory. This file can be used the check the status of the cluster using kubectl or run diagnostics with gkectl.
