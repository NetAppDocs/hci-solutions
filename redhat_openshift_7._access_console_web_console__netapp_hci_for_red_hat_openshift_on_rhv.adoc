To access the console or web console, complete the following steps:

. To access the OCP cluster through the CLI, extract the `oc` command-line tools tar file and place its content in a directory that is in the userâ€™s path.
+

....
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ tar xvf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
README.md
oc
kubectl
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin: /usr/local/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ cp oc /usr/local/bin
....

. To interact with the cluster through the CLI, you can use the `kubeconfig` file provided by the IPI process located in the `/auth` directory inside the folder from where you launched the installation program. To easily interact with the cluster, export the file that is created in the directory. After a successful cluster deployment, the file location and the following command are displayed.
+

....
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/openshift-deploy/auth/kubeconfig
....

. Verify whether you have access to the cluster and whether the nodes are in the Ready state.
+

....
[user@rhel7 openshift-deploy]$ oc get nodes

....

. Log in to the web console URL by using the credentials, both of which were provided after the successful deployment of the cluster, and then verify GUI access to the cluster.
