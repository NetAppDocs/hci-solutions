. Change to the VMware tab and add your two vCenter Servers. When you are defining them,  add a good description and use the Test button.

This example uses an IP address instead of an FQDN. (This FQDN didnâ€™t work at first; I later found out that I had not entered the proper DNS information. After correcting the DNS information, the FQDN worked fine.) Also notice the description, which is useful. 

. After both vCenter Servers are done, the screen displays them.
