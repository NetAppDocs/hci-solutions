Sometimes it is useful to see the screenshots to confirm that the VM is running. It is not logged in, so you cannot tell if the applications are running, but at least you know that the VM is.

== Looking at History When No Failover Is Running

To view past tests or failovers, click the Show Historical button on the Activity tab. Use the magnifying glass for more detail.

You can also download a report with the details.

These reports have various uses: for example, to prove to an application owner that you tested the failover of that application. Also, the report can provide details that might help you troubleshoot a failed failover.

You can add text to a report by adding the text to the plan in the comment field.
