It is hard to know what is required to make a tier 1 application work. It is usually obvious that authentication servers and DNS are important. But is there a database server somewhere too? 

This information is critical because you need to package tier 1 applications so that they work in both a test failover and a real failover. Accounting firms do business impact assessments (BIAs) to provide you with all the necessary information to successfully protect your applicationsâ€”for example, determining the required components, the application owner, and the best support person for the application.
