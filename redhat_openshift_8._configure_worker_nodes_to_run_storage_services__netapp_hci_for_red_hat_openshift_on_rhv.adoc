To configure the worker nodes to run storage services, complete the following steps:

. In order to access storage from the Element system, each of the worker nodes must have iSCSI available and running as a service. To create a machine configuration that can enable and start the iscisd service, log in to the OCP web console and navigate to Compute > Machine Configs and click Create Machine Config. Paste the YAML file and click Create.

. After it is created, it will approximately 20–30 minutes to apply the configuration to the worker nodes and reload them.  Verify whether the machine config is applied by using  `oc get mcp`  and make sure that the machine config pool for workers is updated. You can also log in to the worker nodes to confirm that the iscsid service is running.

[NOTE]
It is also possible to confirm that the MachineConfig has been successfully applied and services have been started as expected by running the  `oc debug`  command with the appropriate flags.
