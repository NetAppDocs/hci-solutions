You now configure Cleondris to communicate with your vCenter Servers and storage. If you have logged out, and you return and log in to start here, you are prompted for some information:

. You will need to accept the EULA.

. You will need to copy and paste the license.

. You will be prompted to do some configuration but skip it. It is better to do it as detailed later in this paper.

. When you log back in and see the green boxes, you must change to the Setup area.
