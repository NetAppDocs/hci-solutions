NetApp Trident is deployed by using an Ansible playbook that is available with NVIDIA DeepOps. Follow these steps to set up NetApp Trident:

. From the Deployment Jump VM, navigate to the DeepOps directory and open a VI editor to `config/group_vars/netapp-trident.yml`. The file from DeepOps lists two backends and two storage classes. In this solution only one backend and storage class are used.
+

Use the following template to update the file and its parameters (highlighted in yellow) to match your environment.

....

. Setup NetApp Trident by using the Ansible playbook.
+

....
ansible-playbook -l k8s-cluster playbooks/netapp-trident.yml
....

. Verify that Trident is running.
+

....
./tridentctl -n trident version
....
+

The expected output is as follows:

....
rarvind@deployment-jump:~/deepops$ ./tridentctl -n trident version
