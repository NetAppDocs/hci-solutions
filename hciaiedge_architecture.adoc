== Solution Technology

This solution is designed with a NetApp HCI system that contains the following components:

* Two H615c compute nodes with NVIDIA T4 GPUs
* Two H410c compute nodes
* Two H410s storage nodes
* Two Mellanox SN2010 10GbE/25GbE switches

A VMware infrastructure is used to host the management services required by this inferencing solution. These services do not need to be deployed on a dedicated infrastructure; they can coexist with any existing workloads. The NetApp Deployment Engine (NDE) uses the H410c and H410s nodes to deploy the VMware infrastructure.

After NDE has completed the configuration, the following components are deployed as VMs in the virtual infrastructure:

* *Deployment Jump VM.* Used to automate the deployment of NVIDIA DeepOps. See link:hciaiedge_design_considerations.html#nvidia-deepops[NVIDIA DeepOps] and storage management using NetApp Trident.
* *ONTAP Select.* An instance of ONTAP Select is deployed to provide NFS file services and persistent storage to the AI workload running on Kubernetes.
* *Kubernetes Masters.* During deployment, three VMs are installed and configured with a supported Linux distribution and configured as Kubernetes master nodes. After the management services have been set up, two H615c compute nodes with NVIDIA T4 GPUs are installed with a supported Linux distribution. These two nodes function as the Kubernetes worker nodes and provide the infrastructure for the inferencing platform.
