As a part of deployment, you can choose the file-services method to host the user profile, shared data, and the home drive folder. The available options are File Server, Azure Files, or Azure NetApp Files. However, after deployment, you can modify this choice with the TestvDC tool to point to any SMB share. There are various advantages to hosting with NetApp ONTAP. For more information, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/virtual-desktop-service/guide_change_storage.html[NetApp Redirecting Storage Platform page^].
