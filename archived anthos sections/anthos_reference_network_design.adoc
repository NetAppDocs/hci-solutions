The NetApp HCI with Anthos solution uses two data switches to provide primary data connectivity at 25Gbps. It also uses two additional management switches that provide connectivity at 1Gbps for in-band management for the storage nodes and out-of-band management for IPMI functionality.

== Cabling Storage Nodes

The management ports A and B must be active on each storage node to run NDE, configure the NetApp HCI cluster, and provide management accessibility to Element after the solution is deployed. The two 25Gbps ports (C and D) should be connected, one to each data switch, to provide physical fault tolerance. The switch ports should be configured for multi-chassis link aggregation (MLAG) and the data ports on the node should be configured for LACP with jumbo-frames support enabled. The IPMI ports on each node can be used to remotely manage the node after it is installed in a data center. With IPMI, the node can be accessed with a web-browser-based console to run the initial installation, run diagnostics, and reboot or shut down the node if necessary.

== Cabling Compute Nodes

The 25Gbps ports on the compute nodes are cabled with one onboard port (C) cabled to one data switch, and an additional port from the PCI slot (E) cabled to the second switch to provide physical fault tolerance. These ports should be configured to support jumbo frames. Connectivity for the node is managed by the vDS after VMware vSphere is deployed in the environment. The IPMI ports can also be used to remotely manage the node after it is installed in a data center. With IPMI, the node can be accessed via a web-browser-based console to run diagnostics and to be rebooted or shut down if necessary.
