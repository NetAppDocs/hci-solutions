The following infrastructure should be in place prior to the deployment of the Anthos on NetApp HCI solution:

* A DHCP server providing addresses for both the in-band management network and the VM network. The DHCP pool must be large enough to support at least 10 VMs for an initial deployment and should be scaled as necessary.
* At least one DNS server providing full host-name resolution that is accessible from the in-band management network and the VM network.
* At least one NTP server that is accessible from the in-band management network and the VM network.
* Outbound internet connectivity for both the in-band management network and the VM network.
